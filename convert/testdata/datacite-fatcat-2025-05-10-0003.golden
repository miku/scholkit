            "content": "Consideration of vacuum consolidation in soft clays with respect to its long-term performance has been extremely limited, especially concerning thick clay deposits having significant creep characteristics. Popular coupled-consolidation elasto-plastic analysis models such as Cam-Clay cannot be used to predict long-term time-dependent deformational behaviour in soft soils. In this paper, a Biot type fully-coupled creep-based viscoplastic finite element analysis numerical model is proposed to predict the time-dependent deformations in thick deposits of soft clays under vacuum consolidation.",
