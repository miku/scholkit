# ARCHITECTURE

Data normalization and grouping. Normalize many different data sources into a
few formats: release, work (clustered releases), container, file and contrib.

* release: a single record describing a bibliographic entity
* work: a group of releases closely related (different versions, pre-print, published, ...)
* container: collection of releases
* file: a web location for a release
* contrib: a contributor to a release

The goal would be to shrink each operation down to a single command then use
outside orchestration, scripting or deployment options to automate things.

* format conversions: "catshape"
