# Fatcat

Fatcat entities:

* release
* work
* container
* file
* contrib
* abstract

## Problem

In fatcat, conversions often will often split up source metadata into different
entities, e.g. crossref will potentially generate release, work, contrib and
abstract entities.

If we do not want to immediately rely on a database for a unified catalog, how
can we still created linked entities? E.g. identify an author by ORCID and
refer to the same author?

Key question is how many own identifier we want to maintain. Google scholar has
some form of identifier, but they call it cluster:

* [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17350290548879842724](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17350290548879842724)

They also have an id per contributor, e.g. [John
Ousterhout](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nDH-AqwAAAAJ). There are
no specific journal entities.

This problem is related to the direction of processing: Do we want a (mostly)
one-way derivation (fast, easy to reason, less identity) or should we
accumulate state over time (slower, more identity).

## Options

* try to reuse existing identifiers; we could use "SOURCE-SHA1", e.g.
  "cros-f0bcda3eb9310557b7005548011e14157e9f10ee", the sha1 should come out same for the same ID; 4 letters should support up to 456976 data sources
* if an id changes, but refers to the same or similar item, it should be covered by the "works" grouping algorithm
* so for works, we need to record the clustering and keep the identifier and we would need to find ways to lookup an metadata item quickly to find the associated cluster
* keeping a works identifier would reflect our own "clustering" work and it would make sense to keep this state around
