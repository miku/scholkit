# Misc observations

To save disk space, we recompress the openalex-works with zstd `-19` - file
shrinks from 316GB to 218GB (0.68 of original), but the compression process
takes 18 hours of full 32 core CPU load.

```
$ time zstdcat -T0 openalex-works-2024-04-17.ndj.zst | pv | zstd -c19 -T0 > openalex-works-2024-04-17.ndj.zst.19

real    1081m31.126s
user    33369m49.024s
sys     27m51.071s
```

Total file size is 2.28TB uncompressed; we can save up to 90% of disk space; or
8TB could hold maybe something like 80TB, 16TB something like 160TB, etc.

Iterating over 250M openalex records takes about 36min, or 116K records/s.

```
$ zstdcat -T0 openalex-works-2024-04-17.ndj.zst | pv -l > /dev/null

Need to deduplicate; and try to shrink it as well.

```
$ time zstdcat -T0 /var/data/share/oaiscrape/2024-04-19-metha-oai.xml.zst | pv | LC_ALL=C sort -S80% -u | zstd -c19 -T0 > /var/data/share/oaiscrape/2024-04-19-metha-oai.xml.zst.19

metha files: 122GB compressed, but only 90M get converted, of which 63486818 are unique; investigating ...
