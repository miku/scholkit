Proposal: "skol", short, already "sko" is unique on most Linux installations;

* skolfeed
* skolconv
* skolpack
```

Example:

* skolfeed, writes data of various upstream data sources to disk; as raw as possible
* skolconv, can convert and normalize various formats into a few common formats
* skolpack, clusters a pile of normalized, but duplicate data into a single catalog
